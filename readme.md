## Description

_[This page](https://gearjosh.github.io/portfolio/) details the continuing development of my programming chops.  It shows what I look like without a beard, some ~~interesting~~ facts about me, and links to the projects I've made so far in my time programming.  Hopefully you'll be amused!_

    - Job Experience
    - Interests, Hobbies, and Skills
    - Trivia
- A blurb up top, with a brief introduction to me
- Links to, and descriptions of seven programming projects:
  - A page detailing my short term programming goals, my first ever attempt at coding.
  - Two unconnected pages containing some fake information about "me."  Done as HTML practice.
  - A page with some made up facts about pangolins, a very cool animal.  Done as HTML and CSS practice.
  - An informational site about a fictional island run by Dr. Moreau where humans can be transformed into animal hybrids.  Contains multiple pages.  Done as HTML/CSS practice.
  - A website about the fictional business _Doctor Cupcake_.  Done to practice more CSS styling.

## References

_A couple of days ago, I looked into how to add a favicon to a page on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9943771/adding-a-favicon-to-a-static-html-page).  That code lives in the head of the HTML because I wanted to get a teeny little screenshot of my Github avatar to show up on the top of the tab._

_I also used the technology of_ a piece of paper and a pen _to map out how to nest my columns and rows so that I could use one well on the left as a sidebar.  I found the method [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16390370/how-can-i-get-a-bootstrap-column-to-span-multiple-rows?rq=1) This would have been nigh impossible without pen and paper._
